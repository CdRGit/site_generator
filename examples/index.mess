| these are kinda neat
| there's a lot of ways to do them

| like, this is an unattributed one
| lol

here's a paragraph being interrupted by a blockquote body
| and this one has the header down below
| which is also good
~ Catelyn

| other markless should also be legal
| # so I can have a quoted header
| yea

~ Catelyn | and here's a continued blockquote
| these look slightly funky but are also good
| yeag

Here's an example of a footnote[1], they're pretty cool

[1] she note on my foot until I meow

|< left
>< center
|> right
|| justified

I can escape \
a newline and it **shouldn't** appear in the output

there's also **bold** text, //italic// text, __underlined__ text, <-struckthrough-> text, ``inline code``, a -- dash, and a --- longer dash
v(subtext) and ^(supertext) and URLs https://tech.lgbt/@catgirlQueer !
also, compound expressions ''meow!''(bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), and ''hidden''(spoiler), also ''big & blue''(blue huge), and ''non-url links''(https://itch.io)

I can also reference the same footnote[1] again, and add -/- literal newlines
